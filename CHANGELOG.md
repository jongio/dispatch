# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`dispatch alias`**: set, reassign, clear (`--clear`), or remove (`--remove`) a session alias from the command line, completing the CLI parity that `tag` and `notes` already have. Supports `--json`.

## [v0.14.0] — 2026-07-18

This release turns Dispatch from a TUI-only tool into a scriptable CLI: most session operations are now available as non-interactive commands with JSON output, and the TUI gains a git status overlay plus several navigation and organization features.

### Added

#### CLI commands
- **`dispatch open`** — resume a session by ID, alias, or short ID prefix. Supports `--last` (most recent), `--print` (print the resume command without launching), `--stdin` (batch resume piped IDs), `--mode` (inplace, tab, window, pane), scoped resume (`--repo`, `--branch`, `--folder`, `--current` to auto-detect from the working directory), and per-launch `--agent`, `--model`, and `--yolo` overrides
- **`dispatch new`** — start a fresh session from the CLI in the current or a given directory, with the same per-launch overrides as `open`
- **`dispatch stats`** — session totals and breakdowns by repository, branch, and host type, with `--json`, `--csv`, `--calendar` (activity heatmap), `--top`, and date/scope filters
- **`dispatch search`** — non-interactive session search with `--json`, `--table`, and `--ids` / `--format ids` output, `--deep` search, and repo/branch/date/limit filters
- **`dispatch export`** — save a session as Markdown, JSON, or HTML, with `--redact` (mask secrets), `--stdout`, and batch export by `--repo`, `--branch`, or `--query`
- **`dispatch config`** — `list`, `get`, `set`, `unset` (reset to default), `edit` (open in your editor), and `path`
- **`dispatch tags`** — list every tag in use with per-tag session counts
- **`dispatch tag <id>`** — add, remove, or set tags on a session (`--add`, `--remove`, `--set`, `--json`)
- **`dispatch notes`** — get, set, or clear a session's local notes
- **`dispatch views`** — list named views and switch the active view
- **`dispatch aliases`** — list every session alias
- **`dispatch compare`** — compare two sessions side by side (metadata, files, refs), with `--json`
- **`dispatch info <id>`** — print a concise summary of one session
- **`dispatch watch`** — monitor attention state across sessions; stream transitions or take a one-shot `--once` snapshot, with `--json` and `--interval`
- **`dispatch prune`** — report and remove stale config entries for sessions that no longer exist (`--apply`, `--json`)
- **`dispatch man`** — generate a roff man page
- **`dispatch completion`** — bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell scripts, with dynamic completion of session aliases and config keys
- **`dispatch doctor --json`** — machine-readable diagnostics; doctor also reports the detected Copilot CLI version and stored session count

#### TUI
- **Git status overlay** (`i`) — shows the git status of the folder a session is mapped to: current branch and upstream, push/pull stats (commits ahead to push, behind to pull), working-tree counts (staged, modified, untracked, deleted, conflicts), and a scrollable changed-file list. The same push/pull stats appear inline on each session row and in the preview pane
- **Open linked reference** (`b`) — open a session's linked pull request, issue, or commit on github.com
- **Frecency sort** — rank sessions by a blend of launch frequency and recency
- **Session tags** (`#`) — attach comma-separated tags and filter with the `tag:` search token
- **Session aliases** (`A`) — give a session a short alias and resume it with `dispatch open <alias>`
- **Fullscreen preview zoom** (`z`) — view the preview pane fullscreen
- **Configurable list columns** — choose which optional columns (repo, folder, turns, host) appear in the session list
- **Jump navigation** — `g` / `Home` jump to top, `G` / `End` jump to bottom
- **Date search tokens** — `after:` and `before:` narrow the list by session activity date
- **Waiting notifications** — optional desktop notification when a session enters the waiting state
- **Configurable keybindings** — remap any key via `config.json`
- **Split-pane launch** — open sessions in a tmux split when running inside tmux
- **Open working directory** (`O`) — open the selected session's working directory in the system file manager (Explorer, Finder, or the Linux file manager)
- **Bulk hide and favorite** — with sessions marked via `Space`, `h` and `*` apply to the whole selection instead of just the cursor session
- **Search query argument** — pass a search string on the command line (`dispatch auth` or `dispatch fix auth bug`) to launch the TUI with the search box pre-filled and the list already filtered

#### Configuration
- **`DISPATCH_CONFIG`** — environment variable to override the config file path
- **Configurable auto-refresh** — set `auto_refresh_seconds` (also in the settings panel) to tune the session-list poll interval, or set it to `0` to turn polling off and refresh only with `r` or reindex

### Changed
- Upgraded Go and website dependencies to latest

### Fixed
- Hardened the swarm CLI commands: `open` scoped resume now picks the most recently active match, `open --current` errors instead of resuming an unrelated session when nothing can be detected, `watch` counts interrupted sessions separately, `stats --csv` neutralizes spreadsheet formula injection, `prune` refuses to apply against an empty store, and `tag` resolves ID prefixes

## [v0.13.0] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Markdown export** (`X`) — export selected sessions as structured Markdown documents to `~/.config/dispatch/exports/`
- **Git workspace badges** — colored status indicators (dirty, untracked, ahead, behind, missing) next to each session based on its working directory
- **Search tokens** — structured filtering in the search bar with `repo:`, `branch:`, `folder:`, `host:`, `status:`, `has:plan`, `is:favorite`, `is:hidden`
- **Preview secret redaction** — automatically masks Bearer tokens, GitHub PATs, Azure connection strings, and .env secrets in the preview pane (toggle in config)
- **Local session notes** (`m`) — attach personal notes to any session, stored locally in config
- **Named views** (`V`) — save and switch between filter presets (e.g., "Work", "Personal")
- **Open touched files** (`F`) — file picker overlay to open files a session touched in your system editor
- **Activity timeline** (`T`) — chronological view of all session events (turns, checkpoints, files, refs) in the preview pane
- **Compare sessions** (`D`) — side-by-side comparison of two selected sessions (metadata, files, refs with diff highlighting)
- **Command palette** (`:`) — filterable overlay listing all available commands with keyboard shortcuts
- "Git changes" filter in the attention picker

### Fixed
- Security: replaced `cmd /c start` with `explorer.exe` for file opening on Windows to prevent command injection
- Reduced false positives in secret redaction (20-char minimum for Bearer, segment boundaries for .env keywords)

### Changed
- Upgraded all Go dependencies to latest
- Extracted string constants for sort fields, time ranges, pivot modes, and sort orders (goconst compliance)

## [v0.12.1] — 2026-06-24

### Changed
- Compacted session list row layout — merged check and cursor into a single selector column, reduced tree indent from 4 to 2 spaces, and fixed host icon to a constant-width column for consistent text alignment
- Added tests for narrow-width rendering, tree-mode indent, and selector state transitions
- Updated indirect dependencies (charmbracelet/ultraviolet, charmbracelet/x/exp/slice)

## [v0.12.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Word filtering** — new `excluded_words` config option and Settings panel field. Enter a comma-separated list of words; sessions whose name or turn content contains any word (case-insensitive) are hidden from the list

## [v0.11.1] — 2026-06-21

### Changed
- Updated all Go dependencies to latest (copilot-sdk v1.0.2, sqlite v1.53.0, lipgloss v2.0.4, x/sync v0.21.0, x/sys v0.46.0, and others)
- Updated astro to v6.4.8 in website
- Bumped actions/checkout from v6 to v7.0.0 in CI workflows
- Applied npm audit fixes (postcss, vite)

## [v0.11.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- **View-state persistence** — sort field, sort order, pivot/grouping, time range, and preview visibility are now saved to `config.json` on every change and restored on next launch
- `default_sort_order` config field (`"asc"` / `"desc"`) for persisting sort direction
- Config versioning and migration system (`config_version` field) to safely evolve settings across dispatch updates
- Migration v0→v1: auto-converts deprecated `launchInPlace` boolean to `launch_mode` string

### Documentation

## [v0.8.0] — 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Work status detection** — analyze `plan.md` files to identify sessions with incomplete planned work (#32)
  - New `WorkStatus` type: Unknown, Complete, Incomplete, NoPlan, Analyzing, Error
  - Plan parsing to detect incomplete tasks (unchecked checkboxes, pending items)
  - Copilot SDK `analyze_completion` tool for AI-powered completion analysis
  - Colored dot indicators in session list showing work completion status
  - Work status display in the preview panel metadata
  - Work status filtering via `!` status picker (incomplete, complete)
  - Status bar shows scan progress and completion summary
- **Shift+arrow range selection** (`Shift+↑` / `Shift+↓`) — select a contiguous range of sessions using Shift+Up/Down arrow keys, matching standard OS file manager behavior (#33). Anchor is set on first shift-press; plain arrow resets. Correctly skips folder nodes in tree mode
- **Conversation sort default** — preview pane conversation now defaults to newest-first (descending). Toggle with `o` key or click the sort arrow next to "Conversation"
- **Interrupted sessions in demo mode** — `dispatch --demo` now shows orange ⚡ interrupted sessions alongside waiting, active, stale, and idle states
- **ANSI-clean preview selection** — copying text from the preview pane now strips ANSI escape codes for clean clipboard content

### Changed

- `!` status picker now includes "Incomplete work", "Complete work", and "Favorites only" rows
- Work status scan no longer runs on startup — press `R` to scan explicitly
- Conversation sort click target enlarged — clicking anywhere on the "Conversation" header zone (separator, label, or gap) toggles sort order
- `conversation_newest_first` config now defaults to `true`; explicit `false` preserved when saved

### Breaking — Keybinding Overhaul

- **`O` → `L`**: "Open selected" renamed to "Launch selected" and moved to `L` (frees `O` so `o`/`O` are no longer an unrelated pair)
- **`F` removed**: "Filter favorites" absorbed into `!` status picker as "Favorites only" row
- **`M` removed**: "Filter plans" absorbed into `!` status picker as "Has plan" row
- **`R` → `N`**: "Resume interrupted" moved to `N` (uppercase; `n` = next waiting — related concepts)
- **`R` = Scan work status** (new): Explicitly scans all sessions with plans for work completion status

### Security

- Eliminate TOCTOU race in `readFileIfExists` and `WriteContinuationPlan` — replaced Lstat-then-operate with open-then-Fstat pattern
- Harden `stripDelimiters` against spaced delimiter variant bypass in prompt injection defense
- Add cancellable context to AI work status scan with 10-minute timeout

### Fixed

- `AttentionInterrupted` missing from sort priority — now correctly sorted at priority 2
- Deep search results and AI session loads now apply full filter chain (attention, plan, work status)
- AI work status fallback for sessions without AI results — continuation plans preserved
- Symlink overwrite vulnerability in `WriteContinuationPlan` — added Lstat safety check
- Auto-generated section feedback loop in plan parser — `stripAutoGeneratedSection` now prevents re-parsing cycles
- Blocking I/O moved off UI thread for work status scanning
- `R` key now re-scans plans before work status for fresh data
- Race detector guard in `mage preflight` — step 8 now skips gracefully when CGO/gcc unavailable
- Flaky test timing in copilot search lock test — replaced `time.Sleep` with channel-based synchronization

## [v0.7.0] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- Release workflow: move contributor notes to temp dir before goreleaser to avoid archive contamination

## [v0.6.0] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **Expand/collapse all toggle** — collapse or expand all folder groups in tree view with a single key (#31). New `default_collapsed` config option
- **Copy session ID** (`c`) — copy the selected session's ID to the system clipboard. Click the ID row in the preview pane for the same effect (#27)
- **"Has plan" status filter** — the `!` attention status picker now includes a "Has plan" row to filter sessions with `plan.md` files (#29)
- **Plan indicator in preview** — sessions with a `plan.md` file show "Plan: Yes" in the preview pane metadata (#22)
- **Configurable preview position** — move the preview pane to right, bottom, left, or top (#18)
- **Conversation sort toggle** (`o`) — toggle between oldest-first and newest-first conversation display in the preview pane; also clickable via the sort arrow in the conversation header
- **Contributor recognition** — automated contributor attribution in releases (#24)
  - `mage contributors` target regenerates CONTRIBUTORS.md from git history
  - `go run ./cmd/contributors/` CLI tool for release-time contributor extraction
  - Co-authored-by trailer parsing (recognizes AI pair programming)

  - First-time contributor detection and highlighting
- **Charm ecosystem v2** — upgraded bubbletea, bubbles, lipgloss, glamour, and copilot-sdk to v2 (#26)

### Changed

- Copy session ID keybinding changed from `y` (yank) to `c` (copy) for better discoverability
- CI skips runs for non-code changes (docs, markdown); pages actions pinned to SHA

### Fixed

- Git Bash MinTTY detection and path quoting (#15, #16)
- Windows Terminal split-pane flags corrected (`-H`/`-V` instead of invalid `--direction`) (#20)
- Worktree PATH shadowing, session ID validation, folder launch constant extraction
